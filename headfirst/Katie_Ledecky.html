        <!--Story Growing Up-->
        <h2>Celebrity Tale</h2>
        <h3>Early Years & Competitive Career</h3>
        <img height="300" src="star_image/ledecky/ledecky_and_brother.jpg" alt="Katie Ledecky">
        <p>Kathleen Genevieve <q>Katie</q> Ledecky was born on March 17, 1997, in Bethesda, Maryland. The second child of David, a lawyer, and Mary Gen, 
            a former collegiate swimmer and hospital administrator, she began swimming competitively at the Palisades Swim & Tennis Club at age six, 
            alongside her older brother, Michael. </p>
            <img height="300" src="star_image/ledecky/young.jpg" alt="Katie Ledecky">
        <p>With her seemingly insatiable appetite for pool activity, Ledecky became a standout at the Nation's Capital Swim Club under coach Yuri Suguiyama. 
            In 2011, Suguiyama began instructing Ledecky to kick more aggressively while racing, a technique commonly used by elite men's swimmers but rarely 
            seen on the women's side. That summer, before the start of her freshman year at Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart, she dominated the U.S. 
            Junior Championships with wins in the 400-, 800- and 1,500- meter freestyle events. </p>
        <h3>2012 London Olympics Breakout Star</h3>
        <p>Ledecky made her senior debut at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, entering the 200-, 400- and 800-meter freestyles. The lack of top-level experience 
            proved to be no obstacle for the 15-year-old, who surged to an eye-opening win in the 800m to become the youngest member of the U.S. team. </p>
            <img height="300" src="star_image/ledecky/London.jpg" alt="Katie Ledecky">
        <p>Her momentum continued through the competition at the 2012 London Games, where Ledecky paced her heat in the 800m. She then blew the competition out of the water in the final, 
            breaking Janet Evans's 23-year-old American record with a time of 8:14.63 to win the gold medal. Afterward, Ledecky displayed the easy confidence of someone who expected to win. 
            <q>I knew if I put my mind to it, I could do it,</q> she said. <q>I wasn't intimidated at all.</q></p>
        <h3>Continued Swimming Success</h3>
        <img height="300" src="star_image/ledecky/water.jpg" alt="Katie Ledecky">
        <p>Under the guidance of new coach Bruce Gemmell, Ledecky showed that her 2012 Olympic performance was merely the tip of the iceberg. 
            Proving capable of winning both middle- and long-distance events, she established world records in the 800- and 1,500-meter freestyles en route to four gold medals 
            at the 2013 FINA World Championships. She claimed another four golds at the 2014 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, and at the 2015 FINA World Championships, 
            she became the first woman to win the 200- 400- 800- and 1500-meter freestyles in a major competition. Her victories often coming via huge margins, 
            Ledecky has been honored as the FINA Swimmer of the Year, the USOC's Olympic SportsWoman of the Year and a three-time Golden Goggle Female Athlete of the Year. </p>
        <h3>2016 Rio Olympics</h3>
        <p>Ledecky did not disappoint in Rio. In her first individual event, the women's 400-meter freestyle, she won gold, soaring past the competition early on 
            and finishing with a time that was two seconds better than her own world record and four seconds more than her second place finisher. 
            She also helped her teammates win silver in the Women's 4x100 meter freestyle relay. She went on to win gold again in the 200-meter freestyle race, 
            edging out Swedish swimmer Sarah Sjostrom, who won silver. After the grueling race, Ledecky spoke about finding the strength to grab the gold. 
            <q>I did come pretty close to throwing up during that last 50,</q> Ledecky said. <q>I knew I just needed to get my hand on the wall and be done.</q> </p>
            <img height="300" src="star_image/ledecky/Rio.jpg" alt="Katie Ledecky">
        <p>She continued to dominate as the anchor in the 4x200 meter freestyle relay, winning the gold medal with teammates Allison Schmitt, Leah Smith and Maya Dirado. 
            She also defended her 2012 world title in the 800-meter individual freestyle in a stunning victory, finishing the race at 8:04:79 and smashing the world record. 
            With this gold win, Ledecky became the second woman to win three individual freestyle events at a single Olympic Games, a feat also accomplished by Debbie Meyer 
            at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. </p>
        <h3>2021 Tokyo Olympics</h3>
        <img height="300" src="star_image/ledecky/Tokyo.jpg" alt="Katie Ledecky">
        <p>In the most recent Olympics held in Tokyo, 2021, Ledecky failed to defend her championship in 400-meter freesstyle, losing to Ariarne Titmus from Australia 
            by less than a second. Defeated in shorter distances, she still dominates the longer distances of 800 meter and 1500 meter freestyle. 
            She led the American team to second place in women's 4x200 meter freestyle relay, after the Chinese team who won gold.
             Both teams broke the previous world record. She pocketed 2 gold and silver medals each this Olympic Games.</p>
        <p>As time goes by, Ledecky shows no sign of slowing down, breaking her own world record time and time again and exemplifing the Olympic spirit of <q>Faster, Higher, Stronger</q>. 
            She has become the flag-bearer of the United States and a pool legend second only to Michael Phelps.
            Her swimming career is estimated to be a considerably long one and more amazing breakthroughs of human limits may be expected from her.

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <img height="300" src="star_image/ledecky/swim.jpg" alt="Katie Ledecky">
        <p>Ledecky is legendary and unique not only in the incredible amount of gold medals to her name, but also in her complete absorbedness and preoccupation
            while swimming. After the epic race in 2016 in Rio, Ledecky confessed that <q>Everything was hurting . . .I just had to dig deep and do my own thing. I had no idea whether I touched first . . .I was done when I touched the wall. 
            I knew I'd given it everything I had to.</q> Too often do people let success slip through their fingertips because of a distracting thought. Ledecky 
            owes her success to utter concentration, which is something we should all learn from her.
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m83kamQi8AU"><img height="300" src="star_image/ledecky/ledecky_fallon.PNG" alt="Katie Ledecky" title="Click to view video on youtube"></a>
        <p>
            Great fame has arrived along with tremendous achievements in swimming, but none of it is getting to Ledecky's head. 
            She continues to focus on the event itself instead of the attached glory and trophies. As a guest on the Fallon show,
            when Fallon brings up the topic that everyone has been calling her <em>the goat</em>, Ledecky said, <q>
            I don't know . . .there are so many great swimmers throughout the years . . .</q> and that she was simply honored to carry on the legacy of great
            American female swimmers. In face of tremendous achievements, she remains modest and recognize others' value just as clearly as her own.
        </p>
        <a href="https://swimswam.com/katie-ledecky-becomes-first-swimmer-to-win-five-straight-world-titles-in-an-event/"><img height="300" src="star_image/ledecky/winner.PNG" alt="Katie Ledecky" title="Ledecky wins 5 straight world titles in an event"></a>
        <p>What marks her as an icon in international sports competition is her desire not merely for winning but also for breakthroughs.
            In the long-distance freestyle events she dominates, she can beat the second-best contestant by up to 10 seconds, but she just keep on going faster.
            <q>She's always pursuing her personal best with fury,</q> says Dave Marsh, coach of the U.S. Olympic women's team. <q>Where's the fury coming from? 
            We don't know, but the stove is running hot.</q>
            Therein lies her aspiration and set of values.
